# Ruby Course - Lesson 1

## The assignment
Create a script that displays the headlines of your favorite website. Make use of OpenURI/Nokogiri.

## What I did
* I started out creating this GIT repository and writing the basic layout of this readme file.
* Doing some reseach on Nokogiri and installing it.
* Following the Tutorial from Nokogiri. Somehow I had to use `require 'rubygems'` at the top of my script and I can't understand why.
* Creating short snippet.
  * I still don't get why I can't also use `puts row.css('description').text;`. Only the title field seems to work. Was it just luck that I had?
